# three-orientation-gizmo
This library creates a orientation gizmo for showing the user how the camera is rotated in space using just an HTML 5 canvas. I love Blender 2.8's new orientation cube and this replicates that for Three.js.

The gizmo has several configurable properties for changing colors, sizing and what axes are visible.

**Dependancies**

 - Three.js (https://www.npmjs.com/package/three)

**Usage**

Include the OrientationGizmo class:

- Web Browser:

    ```html
    <script src="../dist/OrientationGizmo.js"></script>
    ```
    
- Node.js

    ```js
    const OrientationGizmo = require("OrientationGizmo");
    ```
    
Then just create a new Orientation Gizmo, passing in the Three JS Camera to use for the rotation and any options to style it how you want:

```js
var orientationGizmo = new OrientationGizmo(camera, { size: 100, padding: 8 });
document.body.appendChild(orientationGizmo);
```

This library will not rotate your camera for you, but it will give you the direction clicked:
```js
orientationGizmo.onAxisSelected = function(axis) {
  console.log(axis); // { axis: "x", direction: THREE.Vector3(1,0,0) }
}
```

And lastly, you need to call the update() function in your render loop.
```
requestAnimationFrame(() => {
 orientationGizmo.update();
});
```

In the future I might support rotating the camera and changing between ortho and perspective camera but this can vary widely between applications.

**Options**

Here are all the options and their defaults:

```js
{
    size: 90,                         // Size of the canvas
    padding: 8,                       // Adds padding around the gizmo (makes it look nicer when using a circular background)
    bubbleSizePrimary: 8,             // Size of the circle for the positive axes (X,Y,Z)
    bubbleSizeSeconday: 6,            // Size of the circle for the negative axes (-x,-Y,-Z)
    showSecondary: true,              // Show the negative axes bubbles
    lineWidth: 2,                     // Size of the stroke to use for connecting the bubble to the center point
    fontSize: "11px",                 // Size of the label for the axis in the bubble
    fontFamily: "arial",              // Font for the label for the axis in the bubble
    fontWeight: "bold",               // Weight of the label for the axis in the bubble
    fontColor: "#151515",             // Color of the label for the axis in the bubble
    colors: {                         // Array of colors to use for the axes (
        x: ["#f73c3c", "#942424"],    // X-Axis colors [foreground, background]
        y: ["#6ccb26", "#417a17"],    // Y-Axis colors [foreground, background]
        z: ["#178cf0", "#0e5490"],    // Z-Axis colors [foreground, background]
    }
}
```

**Notes**

Blender on hover changes the background to be a light transparent gray circle. To achieve this affect you can do that with just css!

```css
orientation-gizmo:hover {
    background: rgba(255, 255, 255, .2);
    border-radius: 100%;
    cursor: pointer;
}
```
